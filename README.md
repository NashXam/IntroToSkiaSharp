# Intro To SkiaSharp

> _**From [Xamarin.com](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/drawing/introduction/)**_
>
> _SkiaSharp provides a rich and powerful 2D graphics API that can be used to render into 2D buffers. You can use these to implement custom user interface elements and 2D graphics that can be incorporated into your application. SkiaSharp is a .NET binding to the [Skia](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/drawing/introduction/) library and inherits the features and power of this library._
>
> _The library is currently available as a cross-platform [NuGet Package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SkiaSharp), you can it to your project by adding the NuGet reference._

## Learn interactively with [Xamarin Workbooks](https://developer.xamarin.com/workbooks/)

A fun way to get started with new Mobile .NET concepts is to explore the APIs using Xamarin Workbooks.

> _**From [Xamarin.com](https://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/workbooks/)**_
>
> _Xamarin Workbooks provide a blend of documentation and code that is perfect for experimentation, learning, and creating guides and teaching aids._
> 
> _Create a rich C# workbook for Android, iOS, Mac, WPF, or Console, and get instant live results as you learn these APIs._

A few of our exercises will build from existing sample apps and workbooks available at [developer.xamarin.com/workbooks](https://developer.xamarin.com/workbooks/).
